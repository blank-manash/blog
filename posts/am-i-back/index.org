* Am I back?

I am back to blogging after a long time. I have been busy with my work and a long time dissimilarity of leaving the world of linux to find other systems that the world. So I started to learn System Design in order to facilitate myself with all the other ways. I want to revive this blog as I no longer wonder about math support to be added hence this is the first attempt. I will also look into MDWiki but to be supported for Org mode is a godsend and that's something to be proud of.

Anyways to check support there is some code

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import pandas as pd

  ## Create A program to find the sum of all the numbers in a list
  def sum_list(l):
      sum = 0
      for i in l:
          sum += i
      return sum
  #+END_SRC
